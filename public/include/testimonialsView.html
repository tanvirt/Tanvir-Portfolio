                                <p class="quote">Tanvir amazed me with his ability to decipher vague requirements and produce the desired results quickly and with very little effort. He is able to quickly grasp complex business requirements and follow through on their implementation. His technical abilities are very strong, but more rare and exceptional are his abilities to effectively communicate with a large diverse team, with a bare minimum of oversight.</p>
