/**
 * This class controls a Kinect sensor, which is connected to the client's computer. It is compatible with all kinect devices (Kinect for Windows, Kinect for XBOX, new Kinect, or Kinect 2). The kinect device must be turned on using <a href="StartKinect.zip">StartKinect</a> which communicates with the client's browser. The class contains methods to turn on/off the sensor, and receive tracked skeleton data, either continuously or on demand. The skeleton data can be used with the Skeleton class that has several methods to retrieve the positions, orientations, and tracking state of individual joints.  <br><br>
 * <b>Example:</b><br><font style="font-family:Courier">
 * var my_kinect=new Kinect();<br>
 * my_kinect.onInitialized=function(){<br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my_kinect.startStreamingSkeletonData();<br>
